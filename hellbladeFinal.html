      <p>I would overall give Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice a 90 out of 100. This game is one of the most interesting and unique games I've played and it deserves a high rating for everything it has done for people and the ways it has uplifted and told the stories of people who have experienced psychosis. Something I noticed about this game is that it’s a different experience for everyone. You have to be observant to catch everything, which I found as I analyzed the difference between how my mom, a Twitch streamer, and I play this game. I found that I have a better understanding of strategic thinking in terms of fighting and doing what I think the game would want me to do and in what space, yet my mother walks aimlessly around trying to find things when it is apparent it wouldn’t be there. However, this is how the game wants you to play. My mom ends up finding the hidden messages and things I couldn’t have found, like a face in the waterfall, or a hidden cave. When the streamer played, he found the symbols much quicker than my mom and I but was not good at the combat. I realized I’m not giving the fighting as much credit as I should since it is difficult when you first start. One thing that was well done in Hellblade was how everything worked together. The mixture of fire, screaming, distorted sounds of voices, wooden planks falling, intense music, the story of Surtr being told, and people attacking you all at once is what adds to the immersive experience. The game has so many different aspects, new experiences, and history in it. I wish it was longer as it only took me around two weeks to complete, but all good things must come to an end. To summarise my critiques, I think the music could have been more developed and made to stand on it’s own a bit more, and that the effects should have matched the visuals better. The game wasn't accesible to many with psychosis, and some have had negative experiences playing it. For fighting and combat, the use of one weapon and no combinations weakened the ability to fight more strategically in offensive combat. The visuals and aesthetics were mainly beautiful and unique although there were instances of hiccups in the graphics which made navigating combat difficult. Finally, for storytelling, the story wasn’t made that clear, and the ending left more to be desired.
