      <p>Since I was young I have been playing video games with my mom. 
I love Skyrim, Hellblade, Life is Strange, Borderlands, The Last of Us, Genshin Impact, Folklore, etc. Eventually I grew an interest in the development and production of video games so I made my own game on scratch a few years ago while learning how to use the platform. It was really fun and about my sisters cats and I ended up doing two workshops about the process with groups of kids. This got me to gain more of an interest in coding and computer science. I taught myself C# and hope to use it to make games on Unity now that I have time!</p>
