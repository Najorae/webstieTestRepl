        My dad is a teacher and has a company where he integrates science with hip hop so Iâ€™ve been surrounded by science since I was young! We have done shows together performing about the human body. Math was always my favorite subject in school as I enjoy solving puzzles. After experimenting with coding, I found my meticulous nature comes to use and interestingly enough uses similar skills as mixing music/audio engineering which I have also gotten into. I haven't done that much STEM stuff but hope to do more! I've done programs with UC Berkeley, a 14 hour math competition (in which we probably failed miserably haha), a game using not real code, and a lot of teaching myself things on my own. Since I started I've dabbled with C#, Javascript, Python, C++ and a wee bit of HTML & CSS.
