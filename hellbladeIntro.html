      <h1 class="textCenter" style="font-size: 25px; padding: 5px;">Welcome & Introduction</h1>
      
        <p>Welcome to my Game Analysis! I will be analyzing Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice. I chose this game to analyze because Hellblade is one of my favorite games and it is an example of a positive, impactful, well-researched portrayal of a mental health condition in a character. Furthermore, Senua’s Sacrifice highlights what an independent team can do with minimal resources and a tight budget. For this analysis, I will be giving an introduction to the game, analyzing and critiquing the music & sound, combat & enemies, portrayal of mental illness, visuals, and the story. I will then give a rating of the game from my analysis and critiques. Note that this rating will be based on a lot of my opinions from my personal experience with how I like to play games and is not necessarily how everyone else would experience the game if they played it. Also, note that this review is specific to PS4 controls/gameplay. I overall recommend this game to everyone. Enjoy! </p>

  <p> Hellblade, created by Ninja Theory, is an action-adventure, dark fantasy game inspired by Vikings and Celts that takes the player on a quest through the main character’s eyes. This character, Senua, is a warrior on a quest to find her lover Dillian who was killed in a raid. Senua must travel through Helheim, the nordic realm of Hel and the dead, and she encounters various beasts and enemies she must defeat to continue her journey. As she defeats them, players are let into Senua’s past and uncover stories about her family, Dillian, and her experiences with mental illness. In the game, Senua experiences psychosis which is translated into visual and aural hallucinations in the game. Players must navigate through Senua’s reality as they use patterns and their senses to solve riddles that play with perception and illusion.</p>

       <p>The creators’ company, Ninja Theory Limited, is a first-party British video game development studio based in Cambridge, England. It was formed in 2004 by four partners including Nina Kristensen, Tameen Antoniades, and Jex San OBE. Ninja Theory pioneered the use of performance capture and has worked on various games such as Heavenly Sword (one of the first games I watched my mom play), DmC: Devil May Cry, and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.</p>

  <p>Hellblade is neither an AAA game nor an indie game. Ninja Theory created a new title for Senua’s Sacrifice called independent AAA. They say it is about ”creating, funding and owning IP of AAA quality but with the more focused game design, lower price point, and open development process that defines indie games.” Unfortunately, for game development, the team had limited resources and the budget was low, though they were able to take creative approaches to achieve the desired quality they needed for game release. All in all, Ninja Theory created an amazing game that did extensive research on mental health to portray Senua in a respectful and honest light, developed new technology to capture performance efficiently, and showed what an independent group of developers could do.</p>
